  abstract = {Modeling a city poses a number of problems to computer graphics. Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental influences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.},

We introduce an intuitive and flexible modeling framework in which a user can create a street network from scratch or modify an existing street network. This is achieved through designing an underlying tensor field and editing the graph representing the street network. The framework is intuitive because it uses tensor fields to guide the generation of a street network. The framework is flexible because it allows the user to combine various global and local modeling operations such as brush strokes, smoothing, constraints, noise and rotation fields. Our results will show street networks and three-dimensional urban geometry of high visual quality.},

An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht. Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms and can be used to generate self-similar fractals such as iterated function systems.},

Buildings are described in a custom plain-text markup language that can be parsed by Subversion’s procedural generation engine, which renders the 3D models on-screen. The building descriptions are amenable to random generation, crossover and mutation, which enabled us to implement and test a user-driven evolutionary approach to building generation. We performed some fundamental experimentation with ten participants to determine how visually similar child buildings are to their parents, when generated in differing ways. We hope to demonstrate the potential of user-guided evolution for content generation in games in general, as such tools require very little training, time or effort to be employed effectively.},

Gegenstand ist somit die Struktur der Bebauung, die Parzellenbildung als Grundlage für Bauten, die Gebäudetypologie und die Netze der Erschließung. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt liegt in der historischen Analyse der Entwicklung und der Transformation von Stadtstrukturen. Fragen wie Welche Bauformen haben eine lange Lebensdauer und warum? oder Wie elastisch ist das vorhandene Gefüge zur Anpassung an neue Bedürfnisse? und Sind die Merkmale des vorhandenen Bautengefüges auch ein Maßstab für Neubauten? sind nur einige Aspekte, mit denen sich Stadtmorphologen befassen.
Der dabei aufgegriffene Begriff der „Morphologie“ (Gestaltlehre) ist ein genetischer Begriff, der auf Goethe zurückgeht, der ihn für die Lehre von der Genese der Formen einführte. In der Sprache bedeutet Morphologie die Formenlehre die, vom Wort ausgehend, die Analyse der Flexionsformen und der Wortarten umfasst und auch die Wortbildung einbeziehen kann.

Their geometric aspects were beyond the scope of the theory Subsequently, several geometric interpretations of L-systems were proposed with a view to turning them into a versatile tool for plant modeling.

  abstract = {The computer game industry requires a skilled workforce and this combined with the complexity of modern games, means that production costs are extremely high. One of the most time consuming aspects is the creation of game geometry, the virtual world which the players inhabit. Procedural techniques have been used within computer graphics to create natural textures, simulate special effects and generate complex natural models including trees and waterfalls. It is these procedural techniques that we intend to harness to generate geometry and textures suitable for a game situated in an urban environment. Procedural techniques can provide many benefits for computer graphics applications when the correct algorithm is used. An overview of several commonly used procedural techniques including fractals, L-systems, Perlin noise, tiling systems and cellular basis is provided. The function of each technique and the resulting output they create are discussed to better understand their characteristics, benefits and relevance to the city generation problem. City generation is the creation of an urban area which necessitates the creation of buildings, situated along streets and arranged in appropriate patterns. Some research has already taken place into recreating road network patterns and generating buildings that can vary in function and architectural style. We will study the main body of existing research into procedural city generation and provide an overview of their implementations and a critique of their functionality and results. Finally we present areas in which further research into the generation of cities is required and outline our research goals for city generation. 1},

  abstract = {L-systems have been used in Computer Graphics, namely for modelling plants, as well as in a few experiments to model urban environments. However, the lack of geospatial awareness is a limitation and in spite of some developments like open L-systems, that introduced the ability to communicate with the environment, there was a need for more flexibility. This paper presents Geospatial L-systems, a new extension of L-systems that incorporates geospatial awareness, and shows an application in the area of expeditious modelling of urban environments. A modelling system, named XL3D, generates virtual urban environments automatically from a XML based document that contains a modelling specification and accesses data sources in an interoperable way. The integration of geospatial L-systems in this modelling system has increased the potential for automation and the potential to generate virtual urban environments with a higher level of detail and visual fidelity, with a lower level of complexity of the modelling processes. These facts are shown in a case study where a virtual urban environment, taken from an area in the Porto downtown, is generated by this solution.},

Selected examples demonstrate solutions to previously unsolved modeling problems, especially to consistent mass modeling with volumetric shapes of arbitrary orientation.

  abstract = {We present a method for interactive procedural generation of parcels within the urban modeling pipeline. Our approach performs a partitioning of the interior of city blocks using user-specified subdivision attributes and style parameters. Moreover, our method is both robust and persistent in the sense of being able to map individual parcels from before an edit operation to after an edit operation – this enables transferring most, if not all, customizations despite small to large-scale interactive editing operations. The guidelines guarantee that the resulting subdivisions are functionally and geometrically plausible for subsequent building modeling and construction. Our results include visual and statistical comparisons that demonstrate how the parcel configurations created by our method can closely resemble those found in real-world cities of a large variety of styles. By directly addressing the block subdivision problem, we intend to increase the editability and realism of the urban modeling pipeline and to become a standard in parcel generation for future urban modeling methods.},

  abstract = {We propose a method to procedurally generate a familiar yet complex human artifact: the city. We are not trying to reproduce existing cities, but to generate artificial cities that are convincing and plausible by capturing developmental behavior. In addition, our results are meant to build upon themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments, whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions. With the aid of agent based simulation we are generating},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present new solutions for the interactive modeling of city layouts that combine the power of procedural modeling with the flexibility of manual modeling. Procedural modeling enables us to quickly generate large city layouts, while manual modeling allows us to hand-craft every aspect of a city. We introduce transformation and merging operators for both topology preserving and topology changing transformations based on graph cuts. In combination with a layering system, this allows intuitive manipulation of urban layouts using operations such as drag and drop, translation, rotation etc. In contrast to previous work, these operations always generate valid, i.e., intersection-free layouts. Furthermore, we introduce anchored assignments to make sure that modifications are persistent even if the whole urban layout is regenerated.},

  title = {Realtime procedural terrain generation - realtime synthesis of eroded fractal terrain for use in computer games},
  abstract = {The main goal of this paper is to provide an overview of a variety of methods for synthesis of eroded terrain for use in computer games, VR worlds and the like. Traditionally, such software uses either predefined terrains or runtime generated data based on simple fractal noise techniques. In recent years, the advances in processing power of average home computers have made it possible to simulate erosion processes near-realtime by putting emphasis on speed at the expense of physical correctness. This paper presents a fast method to synthesize natural looking fractal terrain and then proceeds to evaluate and suggest optimizations for two of the most commonly used erosion algorithms {[}1, 2]. With some criteria for applicability in computer games in mind, a new and much faster algorithm is then proposed. Finally, a few issues regarding terrain modifications for maximum playability are discussed. Definitions Data representation In the algorithms described in this paper, terrain will be represented by two-dimensional height maps using floating point values between 0 and 1. Unless otherwise stated, all examples use square maps with side length N = 2 9 = 512, giving a total of N 2 = 2 18 = 262144 cells, each cell containing a height value. The height map is denoted H and the individual cells are addressed as hi,j, where i and j are coordinates ranging from 0 to 511. Some calculations will address cells outside this range; in this case, modulo is used to wrap the coordinates around so that the right neighbour of a right-most cell will be the left-most cell in the same row etc. All implementations were done i Java, and all calculation times are from tests executed on a fairly standard 2.4 GHz Pentium 4 PC.
