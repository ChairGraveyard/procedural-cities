  shorttitle = {The {Social} {Life} of {Things}},
  abstract = {The meaning that people attribute to things necessarily derives from human transactions and motivations, particularly from how those things are used and circulated. The contributors to this volume examine how things are sold and traded in a variety of social and cultural settings, both present and past. Focusing on culturally defined aspects of exchange and socially regulated processes of circulation, the essays illuminate the ways in which people find value in things and things give value to social relations. By looking at things as if they lead social lives, the authors provide a new way to understand how value is externalized and sought after. They discuss a wide range of goods - from oriental carpets to human relics - to reveal both that the underlying logic of everyday economic life is not so far removed from that which explains the circulation of exotica, and that the distinction between contemporary economics and simpler, more distant ones is less obvious than has been thought. As the editor argues in his introduction, beneath the seeming infinitude of human wants, and the apparent multiplicity of material forms, there in fact lie complex, but specific, social and political mechanisms that regulate taste, trade, and desire. Containing contributions from American and British social anthropologists and historians, the volume bridges the disciplines of social history, cultural anthropology, and economics, and marks a major step in our understanding of the cultural basis of economic life and the sociology of culture. It will appeal to anthropologists, social historians, economists, archaeologists, and historians of art.},

We introduce an intuitive and flexible modeling framework in which a user can create a street network from scratch or modify an existing street network. This is achieved through designing an underlying tensor field and editing the graph representing the street network. The framework is intuitive because it uses tensor fields to guide the generation of a street network. The framework is flexible because it allows the user to combine various global and local modeling operations such as brush strokes, smoothing, constraints, noise and rotation fields. Our results will show street networks and three-dimensional urban geometry of high visual quality.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present new solutions for the interactive modeling of city layouts that combine the power of procedural modeling with the flexibility of manual modeling. Procedural modeling enables us to quickly generate large city layouts, while manual modeling allows us to hand-craft every aspect of a city. We introduce transformation and merging operators for both topology preserving and topology changing transformations based on graph cuts. In combination with a layering system, this allows intuitive manipulation of urban layouts using operations such as drag and drop, translation, rotation etc. In contrast to previous work, these operations always generate valid, i.e., intersection-free layouts. Furthermore, we introduce anchored assignments to make sure that modifications are persistent even if the whole urban layout is regenerated.},

  abstract = {Modeling a city poses a number of problems to computer graphics. Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental influences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.},

  abstract = {Stadtmorphologie ist ein Forschungsgebiet des Städtebaus und der Stadtgeographie. Die Stadtmorphologie befasst sich mit den Siedlungs- und Stadtformen sowie mit den physischen Formungsprozessen innerhalb der Siedlungskörper. Gegenstand ist somit die Struktur der Bebauung, die Parzellenbildung als Grundlage für Bauten, die Gebäudetypologie und die Netze der Erschließung. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt liegt in der historischen Analyse der Entwicklung und der Transformation von Stadtstrukturen. Fragen wie Welche Bauformen haben eine lange Lebensdauer und warum? oder Wie elastisch ist das vorhandene Gefüge zur Anpassung an neue Bedürfnisse? und Sind die Merkmale des vorhandenen Bautengefüges auch ein Maßstab für Neubauten? sind nur einige Aspekte, mit denen sich Stadtmorphologen befassen.
Der dabei aufgegriffene Begriff der „Morphologie“ (Gestaltlehre) ist ein genetischer Begriff, der auf Goethe zurückgeht, der ihn für die Lehre von der Genese der Formen einführte. In der Sprache bedeutet Morphologie die Formenlehre die, vom Wort ausgehend, die Analyse der Flexionsformen und der Wortarten umfasst und auch die Wortbildung einbeziehen kann. Im Bereich der physischen Geographie behandelt die Geomorphologie Formen und formbildende Prozesse der Oberfläche von Erde und Himmelskörpern.},

Our approach largely focuses upon land usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments, whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions.

Context sensitive shape rules allow the user to specify interactions between the entities of the hierarchical shape descriptions. Selected examples demonstrate solutions to previously unsolved modeling problems, especially to consistent mass modeling with volumetric shapes of arbitrary orientation. CGA shape is shown to efficiently generate massive urban models with unprecedented level of detail, with the virtual rebuilding of the archaeological site of Pompeii as a case in point.},

  abstract = {The computer game industry requires a skilled workforce and this combined with the complexity of modern games, means that production costs are extremely high. One of the most time consuming aspects is the creation of game geometry, the virtual world which the players inhabit. Procedural techniques have been used within computer graphics to create natural textures, simulate special effects and generate complex natural models including trees and waterfalls. It is these procedural techniques that we intend to harness to generate geometry and textures suitable for a game situated in an urban environment. Procedural techniques can provide many benefits for computer graphics applications when the correct algorithm is used. An overview of several commonly used procedural techniques including fractals, L-systems, Perlin noise, tiling systems and cellular basis is provided. The function of each technique and the resulting output they create are discussed to better understand their characteristics, benefits and relevance to the city generation problem. City generation is the creation of an urban area which necessitates the creation of buildings, situated along streets and arranged in appropriate patterns. Some research has already taken place into recreating road network patterns and generating buildings that can vary in function and architectural style. We will study the main body of existing research into procedural city generation and provide an overview of their implementations and a critique of their functionality and results. Finally we present areas in which further research into the generation of cities is required and outline our research goals for city generation. 1},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new method for the automatic modeling of architecture. Building designs are derived using split grammars, a new type of parametric set grammar based on the concept of shape. The paper also introduces an attribute matching system and a separate control grammar, which offer the flexibility required to model buildings using a large variety of different styles and design ideas. Through the adaptive nature of the design grammar used, the created building designs can either be generic or adhere closely to a specified goal, depending on the amount of data available.},

  abstract = {We present a method for interactive procedural generation of parcels within the urban modeling pipeline. Our approach performs a partitioning of the interior of city blocks using user-specified subdivision attributes and style parameters. Moreover, our method is both robust and persistent in the sense of being able to map individual parcels from before an edit operation to after an edit operation – this enables transferring most, if not all, customizations despite small to large-scale interactive editing operations. The guidelines guarantee that the resulting subdivisions are functionally and geometrically plausible for subsequent building modeling and construction. Our results include visual and statistical comparisons that demonstrate how the parcel configurations created by our method can closely resemble those found in real-world cities of a large variety of styles. By directly addressing the block subdivision problem, we intend to increase the editability and realism of the urban modeling pipeline and to become a standard in parcel generation for future urban modeling methods.},

Buildings are described in a custom plain-text markup language that can be parsed by Subversion’s procedural generation engine, which renders the 3D models on-screen. The building descriptions are amenable to random generation, crossover and mutation, which enabled us to implement and test a user-driven evolutionary approach to building generation. We performed some fundamental experimentation with ten participants to determine how visually similar child buildings are to their parents, when generated in differing ways. We hope to demonstrate the potential of user-guided evolution for content generation in games in general, as such tools require very little training, time or effort to be employed effectively.},

Originally, they did not include enough detail to allow for comprehensive modeling of higher plants. The emphasis was on plant topology, that is, the neighborhood relations between cells or larger plant modules. Their geometric aspects were beyond the scope of the theory Subsequently, several geometric interpretations of L-systems were proposed with a view to turning them into a versatile tool for plant modeling. Throughout this book, an interpretation based on turtle geometry is used {[}109]. Basic notions related to L-system theory and their turtle interpretation are presented below.},
