  shorttitle = {The {Social} {Life} of {Things}},
  abstract = {The meaning that people attribute to things necessarily derives from human transactions and motivations, particularly from how those things are used and circulated. The contributors to this volume examine how things are sold and traded in a variety of social and cultural settings, both present and past. Focusing on culturally defined aspects of exchange and socially regulated processes of circulation, the essays illuminate the ways in which people find value in things and things give value to social relations. By looking at things as if they lead social lives, the authors provide a new way to understand how value is externalized and sought after. They discuss a wide range of goods - from oriental carpets to human relics - to reveal both that the underlying logic of everyday economic life is not so far removed from that which explains the circulation of exotica, and that the distinction between contemporary economics and simpler, more distant ones is less obvious than has been thought. As the editor argues in his introduction, beneath the seeming infinitude of human wants, and the apparent multiplicity of material forms, there in fact lie complex, but specific, social and political mechanisms that regulate taste, trade, and desire. Containing contributions from American and British social anthropologists and historians, the volume bridges the disciplines of social history, cultural anthropology, and economics, and marks a major step in our understanding of the cultural basis of economic life and the sociology of culture. It will appeal to anthropologists, social historians, economists, archaeologists, and historians of art.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of interactively modeling large street networks. We introduce an intuitive and flexible modeling framework in which a user can create a street network from scratch or modify an existing street network. This is achieved through designing an underlying tensor field and editing the graph representing the street network. The framework is intuitive because it uses tensor fields to guide the generation of a street network. The framework is flexible because it allows the user to combine various global and local modeling operations such as brush strokes, smoothing, constraints, noise and rotation fields. Our results will show street networks and three-dimensional urban geometry of high visual quality.},

  abstract = {Modeling a city poses a number of problems to computer graphics. Every urban area has a transportation network that follows population and environmental influences, and often a superimposed pattern plan. The buildings appearances follow historical, aesthetic and statutory rules. To create a virtual city, a roadmap has to be designed and a large number of buildings need to be generated. We propose a system using a procedural approach based on L-systems to model cities. From various image maps given as input, such as land-water boundaries and population density, our system generates a system of highways and streets, divides the land into lots, and creates the appropriate geometry for the buildings on the respective allotments. For the creation of a city street map, L-systems have been extended with methods that allow the consideration of global goals and local constraints and reduce the complexity of the production rules. An L-system that generates geometry and a texturing system based on texture elements and procedural methods compose the buildings.},

  abstract = {Stadtmorphologie ist ein Forschungsgebiet des Städtebaus und der Stadtgeographie. Die Stadtmorphologie befasst sich mit den Siedlungs- und Stadtformen sowie mit den physischen Formungsprozessen innerhalb der Siedlungskörper. Gegenstand ist somit die Struktur der Bebauung, die Parzellenbildung als Grundlage für Bauten, die Gebäudetypologie und die Netze der Erschließung. Ein besonderer Schwerpunkt liegt in der historischen Analyse der Entwicklung und der Transformation von Stadtstrukturen. Fragen wie Welche Bauformen haben eine lange Lebensdauer und warum? oder Wie elastisch ist das vorhandene Gefüge zur Anpassung an neue Bedürfnisse? und Sind die Merkmale des vorhandenen Bautengefüges auch ein Maßstab für Neubauten? sind nur einige Aspekte, mit denen sich Stadtmorphologen befassen.
Der dabei aufgegriffene Begriff der „Morphologie“ (Gestaltlehre) ist ein genetischer Begriff, der auf Goethe zurückgeht, der ihn für die Lehre von der Genese der Formen einführte. In der Sprache bedeutet Morphologie die Formenlehre die, vom Wort ausgehend, die Analyse der Flexionsformen und der Wortarten umfasst und auch die Wortbildung einbeziehen kann. Im Bereich der physischen Geographie behandelt die Geomorphologie Formen und formbildende Prozesse der Oberfläche von Erde und Himmelskörpern.},

An L-system consists of an alphabet of symbols that can be used to make strings, a collection of production rules that expand each symbol into some larger string of symbols, an initial "axiom" string from which to begin construction, and a mechanism for translating the generated strings into geometric structures. L-systems were introduced and developed in 1968 by Aristid Lindenmayer, a Hungarian theoretical biologist and botanist at the University of Utrecht. Lindenmayer used L-systems to describe the behaviour of plant cells and to model the growth processes of plant development. L-systems have also been used to model the morphology of a variety of organisms and can be used to generate self-similar fractals such as iterated function systems.},

  abstract = {The computer game industry requires a skilled workforce and this combined with the complexity of modern games, means that production costs are extremely high. One of the most time consuming aspects is the creation of game geometry, the virtual world which the players inhabit. Procedural techniques have been used within computer graphics to create natural textures, simulate special effects and generate complex natural models including trees and waterfalls. It is these procedural techniques that we intend to harness to generate geometry and textures suitable for a game situated in an urban environment. Procedural techniques can provide many benefits for computer graphics applications when the correct algorithm is used. An overview of several commonly used procedural techniques including fractals, L-systems, Perlin noise, tiling systems and cellular basis is provided. The function of each technique and the resulting output they create are discussed to better understand their characteristics, benefits and relevance to the city generation problem. City generation is the creation of an urban area which necessitates the creation of buildings, situated along streets and arranged in appropriate patterns. Some research has already taken place into recreating road network patterns and generating buildings that can vary in function and architectural style. We will study the main body of existing research into procedural city generation and provide an overview of their implementations and a critique of their functionality and results. Finally we present areas in which further research into the generation of cities is required and outline our research goals for city generation. 1},

The building descriptions are amenable to random generation, crossover and mutation, which enabled us to implement and test a user-driven evolutionary approach to building generation. We performed some fundamental experimentation with ten participants to determine how visually similar child buildings are to their parents, when generated in differing ways. We hope to demonstrate the potential of user-guided evolution for content generation in games in general, as such tools require very little training, time or effort to be employed effectively.},

Their geometric aspects were beyond the scope of the theory Subsequently, several geometric interpretations of L-systems were proposed with a view to turning them into a versatile tool for plant modeling. Throughout this book, an interpretation based on turtle geometry is used {[}109]. Basic notions related to L-system theory and their turtle interpretation are presented below.},
